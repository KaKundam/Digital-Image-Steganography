🛡️ Spectral-Stego: Transform Domain Steganography
Spectral-Stego is a digital image steganography tool that hides secret data within the frequency domain of an image. Unlike standard LSB (Spatial Domain) methods, this tool utilizes mathematical transforms to embed data, making the hidden information more robust against compression, cropping, and visual inspection.

🚀 Key Features
Transform Domain Embedding: Support for DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform).

High Robustness: Hidden data is less susceptible to image processing attacks.

Dual-Interface: Use the CLI Script for batch processing or the Web App for a visual demo.

Frequency Visualization: View the magnitude spectrum of your images.
